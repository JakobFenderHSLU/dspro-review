""" # Review Sentiment Classifier"""
""" This project was created by Jakob Fender as part of the course DSPRO-1 at the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences
 and Arts. The goal of this project is to create a classifier that can predict the sentiment of a review. This project
is split into two parts:
 
 
## Movie Review Classifier
The first part is a classifier for movie reviews. It uses a dataset of 50'000 movie reviews from IMDB. The classifier 
is trained on 40'000 reviews and tested on 10'000 reviews.It returns a simple positive or negative score for each 
review. The classifier can be trained with different methods. The following methods are available:
- Custom
- Out of the box
- Neural Network

## Product Review Classifier
The second part is a classifier for product reviews. It uses a dataset of 1'000'000 product reviews from Amazon. Due to 
the large size of the dataset, and computing restraints we can only deploy small classifiers.
